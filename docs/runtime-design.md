# Runtime Design

Status: read-only commands frozen

## Command surface

The current release exposes read-only job and resource commands:

```bash
sai status --site site-a --format tui
sai status --site site-a --format json
sai jobs list --site site-a
sai jobs list --site site-a --scope org-account --account org-example
sai jobs list --site site-a --scope project-account --account project-example \
  --states R,PD --partition gpu-standard --limit 100
sai jobs show 12345 --site site-a
sai jobs show 12345 --site site-a --scope project-account \
  --account project-example
sai jobs cost --site site-a
sai jobs cost --site site-a --scope project-account \
  --account project-example --states R,PD --partition gpu-standard
sai resources catalog --site site-a --format table
```

`--format json` is the default. `--format table` is intended for a person at a
terminal. JSON is always written to stdout; diagnostics are written to stderr.

The first release does not implement:

- job submission, cancellation, hold, requeue, suspend, or QOS changes;
- normal-user all-site or all-account queries;
- raw scheduler user filters;
- automatic fallback from live state to broad accounting queries;
- node topology, physical assets, utilization or storage management commands.

`storage quota-summary --workspace-key personal:example` reads Portal's stored
quota observation under the independent `sai.storage.read` Identity scope.
Workspace and site are explicit; this is not an on-demand native storage read.
No site capability, recursive scan, permission change or fee calculation occurs.

`storage native-quota --workspace-key project:example` instead obtains a separate
`storage.quota.read` capability and reads native Lustre quota subjects from the
configured gateway. Its exact byte/inode counters and per-subject observation
times describe physical quotas, not the organization's whole funding pool.
There is no source fallback. The TUI Storage selector uses the same two client
methods and clears old-source results immediately. Native deployment requires
a reviewed readable filesystem anchor; local code does not enable it.

`sai tui` starts with the default-identity Overview and is an optional interactive
consumer of these same read methods.
It keeps the configured site/cluster fixed, lets users explicitly apply job
scope and narrowing filters, compares published partitions, and shows job
detail and independent running estimates. Its dependencies are an optional
extra; JSON batch commands do not import or require them. Interaction and
verification boundaries are in [terminal-workbench.md](terminal-workbench.md).

Optional TOML `site_read_base_url` selects direct site reads for `jobs list`,
`jobs show` and `storage native-quota`. `jobs allocation JOB_ID` also requires
this setting and returns the versioned allocation snapshot without a central
fallback. These reads require capability mode and an explicit cluster.
The origin is HTTPS (unmanaged loopback HTTP for local tests); no argv or
environment override is accepted. Managed installations use the existing
protected configuration, not a new per-command mount or file hierarchy.

The gateway receives only a short-lived `X-SAI-Capability`; the Identity Bearer
stays at Portal. Results use the explicit `jobs/v1` envelope, including subject,
observation time, freshness, ETag and `has_more`, without a fabricated visibility
role. Gateway failures stop the request. The cost/catalog/auth commands keep
their existing central contracts; they do not test a gateway and fall back.

`resources catalog` returns published compute specifications, QOS names,
storage products and prices. It accepts a site and output format, not job
scope/account/cluster filters. Managed mode uses an Identity-only central read
route; no site capability, scheduler read or local pricing engine is involved.
Published capacities are not idle resources or a guarantee of eligibility.
Unknown capacities remain null in JSON and `unknown` in the table.

`jobs cost` calls Portal `GET /v1/billing/running-estimates`. It reuses the
list command's scope and narrowing options, validates the independent
`billing.running-estimate/v1` DTO, and renders it without local caching,
scheduler access, or price calculation.

The controller-side `site/slurm/job_submit.lua` artifact does not change this
client boundary. It validates jobs submitted through native Slurm commands but
does not expose a `sai jobs submit` command.

Unimplemented command families remain in the roadmap rather than appearing as
placeholders that return fake data.

The current legacy Portal endpoint uses `portal_read` authorization and can
accept an `agent_only` account. Production login-node rollout remains blocked
until (a) SAI Identity issues the registered Portal-audience token, (b) Portal
verifies that token and its CLI surface, and (c) the server-verifiable CLI
surface enforces shell access `enabled`; client headers or local checks cannot
establish that authorization boundary.

## Scope selection

`--scope` accepts `self`, `personal-account`, `org-account`, or
`project-account`.

- `self` rejects account selectors.
- `personal-account`, `org-account`, and `project-account` require exactly one
  of `--account` or `--account-id` under the current Portal contract.
- The CLI maps hyphenated user-facing values to the control-plane underscore
  values. The server remains authoritative.

`--states` is a comma-separated allowlisted token list. `--partition` only
narrows the result.  The running-estimate endpoint deliberately returns the
complete authorized live snapshot and has no client `--limit` parameter.

## Configuration

Configuration precedence is:

1. command-line non-secret options;
2. environment variables;
3. the selected TOML profile;
4. built-in non-secret defaults.

Default config path:

```text
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/sai/config.toml
~/.config/sai/config.toml
```

Example:

```toml
default_profile = "default"

[profiles.default]
base_url = "https://portal.example.org"
identity_issuer = "https://id.example.org/realms/sai"
oidc_client_id = "sai-cli"
oidc_scope = "openid offline_access sai.compute.read sai.billing.read sai.storage.read"
oidc_resource = "sai-portal"
site_id = "site-a"
username = "alice"
key_id = "managed-login"
timeout_seconds = 10
```

Tokens and shared secrets are rejected in the TOML file. They must be supplied
through a short-lived environment or a managed node credential mechanism.

Relevant environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SAI_API_BASE_URL` | Control-plane base URL |
| `SAI_SITE_ID` | Default site |
| `SAI_PROFILE` | Profile name |
| `SAI_API_USERNAME` | Actor username for unmanaged compatibility token exchange |
| `SAI_API_KEY_ID` | Client key identifier for unmanaged compatibility exchange |
| `SAI_TOKEN` | Already-issued short-lived Bearer token |
| `SAI_API_SHARED_SECRET` | Protected HMAC secret for unmanaged compatibility exchange |
| `SAI_API_TIMEOUT` | HTTP timeout in seconds |
| `SAI_CREDENTIAL_CACHE` | Optional unmanaged path for the protected device refresh cache |
| `SAI_IDENTITY_ISSUER` | SAI Identity OIDC issuer used by `sai auth login` |
| `SAI_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | Pre-registered public OIDC client identifier |
| `SAI_OIDC_SCOPE` | Reviewed OIDC scopes for the Portal resource (includes `offline_access`) |
| `SAI_OIDC_RESOURCE` | Optional Portal resource/audience identifier |
| `SAI_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` | Development-only explicit HTTP override |
| `SAI_REQUIRE_SITE_CAPABILITY` | Require the server-bound capability/CLI routes; mandatory in managed production wrappers |

## Authentication

Token selection order is:

1. use `SAI_TOKEN` for the current process without writing it to disk;
2. reuse a valid CLI device access token;
3. rotate a valid SAI Identity OIDC refresh credential at the discovered
   `token_endpoint`;
4. reuse a legacy protected cache entry;
5. for an unmanaged compatibility client, exchange a HMAC request at
   `POST /v1/token` and cache only the returned short-lived Bearer token.
   Managed login nodes never carry the HMAC secret; they use SAI Identity's
   OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant after a one-time browser approval.

The HMAC canonical string is part of the existing Portal compatibility
contract:

```text
username + "\n" + unix_timestamp + "\n" + nonce + "\n" + key_id
```

The compatibility secret is not a general login mechanism. `sai auth login`
uses a short-lived browser/device authorization and persists only a rotating,
revocable refresh credential. The CLI must not accept a secret, Bearer token,
or refresh credential as a command-line argument because process listings and
shell history are not secret stores.

For managed production use, Bearer authentication is followed by a capability
exchange at `POST /v1/authz/site-read` with the exact JSON request body. The response is cached as an opaque
short-lived credential keyed by the user-session digest, operation, site,
scope, exact filters, and job ID. Jobs and running-estimate reads then use
`/v1/slurm/cli/...` or `/v1/billing/cli/...`; the server revalidates both the
Bearer actor and the signed grant. A cached Bearer or capability is refreshed
at most once after authentication failure.

## Token and device credential caches

Cache path precedence is:

```text
${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/sai/token-cache.json
${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/sai/token-cache.json
~/.cache/sai/token-cache.json
```

Requirements:

- directory mode `0700`, file mode `0600`;
- no symbolic-link cache files;
- atomic same-directory replacement;
- entries keyed by normalized base URL, username, and key ID;
- a token is considered expired before its actual expiry to leave request
  margin;
- malformed or weak-permission caches fail closed with a bounded diagnostic.

The device refresh cache defaults to
`${XDG_DATA_HOME}/sai/credentials.json` or
`~/.local/share/sai/credentials.json` and has the same `0700/0600`, symlink,
atomic-replacement, and ownership requirements. A per-user lock serializes
refresh-token rotation across concurrent CLI processes.

Refresh expiry may be unknown: OAuth does not require an expiry extension, and
some providers return zero for server-managed offline sessions. Only refresh
credentials may store an explicit null expiry; access tokens and pending device
codes still require a finite expiry. Unknown expiry does not imply permanent
validity: the issuer enforces idle limits, revocation, and account state.

Managed `/opt/sai/cli/config.toml` additionally requires a root-owned regular
file beneath root-owned, non-group/world-writable, non-symlink directories.
This applies only to the managed path; XDG paths retain per-user rules.

## HTTP behavior

- The base URL must be HTTPS unless it resolves syntactically to a loopback
  host or the development override is explicit.
- Requests have a bounded timeout and response-size limit.
- Each request carries a client-generated request ID.
- Redirects are not used to broaden trust to another host.
- Non-2xx responses are mapped to stable CLI error categories.
- Only a bounded server `detail.code`, `detail.message`, or string detail is
  eligible for display, after secret-pattern redaction.
- A non-object JSON payload is a contract failure.

## Output contract

JSON output contains only the stable job visibility or running-estimate fields documented in
[portal-api-contract.md](portal-api-contract.md). Unknown response fields are
ignored after validation instead of being copied to stdout.

Running-estimate table output always shows `final=false`, `as_of`, observation
time, age, stale state, and ETag. Times use the response's required site/Slurm
IANA timezone and show an explicit offset, never the center or terminal local
timezone. A pending job has no zero-cost claim; an
unavailable estimate has no guessed amount. Both remain explicit row states.

Table mode keeps the established SAI meanings:

- `GPU` is GPU count per node, not total GPU count.
- `MemPerU` is host memory per GPU or CPU logical unit.
- `Slots` can describe requested tasks while pending and allocated CPU slots
  while running.
- `Reason/Nodelist` is a pending reason or the allocated node expression,
  depending on state.

Table rendering uses no ANSI color by default so redirects and wrapper output
remain deterministic.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success |
| `2` | Command or configuration error |
| `3` | Authentication failed or credentials unavailable |
| `4` | Authorized identity lacks the requested permission |
| `5` | Object not found or not visible |
| `6` | Authorized source temporarily unavailable |
| `7` | Server/client contract invalid |
| `8` | Network or timeout failure |

In JSON mode, errors are emitted as a small JSON object on stderr. In table
mode they are emitted as one plain diagnostic line.

## Legacy wrapper migration

Site-specific legacy commands may later become package-managed wrappers around
the canonical CLI. A wrapper may translate an old command name and select table
format, but it must not query the scheduler directly or implement authorization.

The rollout sequence is: inventory and checksum, stage the new package, canary
through an explicit path, atomically switch package-managed wrappers, validate,
and retain a package-level rollback. This repository does not authorize manual
editing of production command directories.
